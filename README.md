# Zettle SDK for iOS

The Zettle SDK makes it possible to accept card payments with a Zettle card reader from any iOS app.
When triggered, it will display a screen over the host application where all interaction takes place. It
is designed to be easy to implement and use.

Card payments with Zettle are currently supported in the following markets:

-   United States
-   United Kingdom

## Requirements

- Xcode 11+
- `ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES = YES` flag is required if your project doesn't include swift
- iOS 10+
- Client ID from the Zettle Developer Portal

## Installation

You can install Zettle SDK in several ways:

1. [CocoaPods](#cocoapods)
2. [Manual Installation](#manual-installation)

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org/) is an easy way to install ZettleSDK.

1. Add following pod to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'

target 'Your App' do
    pod 'iZettleSDK'
end
```

### Manual Installation

1. Drag the binary frameworks from the `iZettleSDK` folder into your Xcode project:

```
iZettleSDK.xcframework
iZettlePayments.xcframework
```

## Usage

To be able to use Zettle SDK you are **required** to setup several things first

```
⚠️ An exception will be thrown if these are not selected
```

### 1. Setup external accessory protocols in your `Info.plist`

Add/modify the property `Supported external accessory protocols` and add `com.izettle.cardreader-one`.

This is what it should look like in the "source code" view of your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UISupportedExternalAccessoryProtocols</key>
<array>
    <string>com.izettle.cardreader-one</string>
</array>
```

#### Important

The Zettle bluetooth card readers are part of the Apple MFi program. In order to release apps supporting accessories that are part of the MFi Program, you have to apply at Apple. Please contact us at [sdk@izettle.com](mailto:sdk@izettle.com) and we will help you with this process.

### 2. Setup external accessory communication background mode

#### 2.1 Xcode 11

To enable support for external accessory communication in Xcode 11 select the following background modes. These options can be found under `Signing & Capabilities` in your target.

- `External accessory communication`
- `Uses Bluetooth LE accessory`

#### 2.2 Earlier Xcode versions

Enable support for external accessory communication from the Background modes section of the Capabilities tab in your Xcode project.

#### 2.3 Edit plist

Edit your **Info.plist** file to have the following information set:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>bluetooth-central</string>
    <string>external-accessory</string>
</array>

<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Our app uses bluetooth to find, connect and transfer data with Zettle card reader devices.</string>

<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>Our app uses bluetooth to find, connect and transfer data with Zettle card reader devices.</string>

<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>"The scheme of your OAuth Redirect URI *"</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Note that the texts for the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` and `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription` keys will be displayed when iOS asks the user for permissions to allow your app access to bluetooth capabilities. You may want to update the texts to your requirements.

\* If you don't remember the scheme of your OAuth Redirect URI, you can double check it on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.izettle.com/)

### 3. Setup CLLocationManager in your `Info.plist`

Zettle will prompt the user for permission during the first payment if the merchant haven't already granted your app this permission. Zettle will execute CLLocationManagers method
`requestWhenInUseAuthorization`.

Add the key in your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>You need to allow this to be able to accept card payments</string>
```

Zettle won't accept payments without these texts implemented.

### 4. Import SDK framework

Make sure to include the Zettle SDK framework:

**Objective C:**

```objectivec
@import iZettleSDK; 
```

**Swift:**

```swift
import iZettleSDK
```

### 5. Initialize the SDK

Before you execute any operation with the Zettle SDK, you have to initialize it with an object conforming to the `iZettleSDKAuthorizationProvider` protocol. This protocol defines set of methods that can authorize Zettle users inside your application. The Zettle SDK provides an `iZettleSDKAuthorization` object that implements this protocol out of the box.

User authorization in the SDK is perfomed through the implementation of OAuth 2.0. This means that the Zettle SDK requires Client ID and a callback url from your integrating application.

To obtain Client ID, create an account in the [Zettle Developer Portal](https://developer.izettle.com/login?continue=%2F) and create an iOS SDK developer application. Once you complete that process, you'll be given a Client ID which can be used to initialize the SDK.

```swift
let authenticationProvider = try iZettleSDKAuthorization(
    clientID: "xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx",
    callbackURL: URL(string: "app-scheme://url"))

iZettleSDK.shared().start(with: authenticationProvider)
```

If you support iOS 10 and iOS 11, you'll need to override AppDelegate `application:openURL:options:` method:

```swift
func application(
  _ app: UIApplication,
  open url: URL,
  options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    return iZettleSDK.shared().applicationDidOpen(with: url)
}
```

The `ZettleSDK.shared().applicationDidOpen(with: url)` call will check if the `url` is a valid callback URL, handle it and return `true`. If the `url` is not the callback URL or is invalid the method will return `false`.

## SDK Operations

⚠️ **Important:** Only use the singleton instance returned from `[iZettleSDK shared]` (in Objective C) or `iZettleSDK.shared()` (in Swift) when calling the methods below.

Asynchronous operations have a completion block as an argument, the completion block is called when an 
operation is considered complete, cancelled or failed. See [iZettleOperationCompletion](#izettleoperationcompletion) for more information.

Zettle SDK will handle presentation and dismissal of its views. Operations with UI will accept a UIViewController as an argument from which Zettle SDK will be presented.

If the user isn't yet authenticated with Zettle when an operation is presented, a login screen will automatically be displayed.

* [Refunding](#refunding)
* [Retrieving payment info](#retrieve-payment-info)

* [Enforced User Account](#enforced-user-account)

### Charging

Perform a payment with an amount and a reference:

```objective-c
- (void)chargeAmount:(NSDecimalNumber *)amount
       enableTipping:(BOOL)enableTipping
           reference:(NSString *)reference
presentFromViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController
          completion:(iZettleOperationCompletion)completion;
```

```swift
 open func charge(amount: NSDecimalNumber, 
  currency: String?, 
  enableTipping: Bool, 
  reference: String?, 
  presentFrom viewController: UIViewController, 
  completion: @escaping iZettleSDK.iZettleSDKOperationCompletion)
```

- `amount`: The amount to be charged in the logged in users currency.
- `enableTipping`: Perform payment with tipping flow
- `currency` _(optional)_: Only used for validation. If the value of this parameter doesn't match the users currency the user will be notified and then logged out. For a complete list of valid currency codes, see [ISO 4217](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php)
- `reference` _(optional)_: The payment reference. Used to identify a Zettle payment, used when retrieving payment information at a later time or performing a refund. Max length 128.


#### Note on tipping

Passing `enableTipping` to the `charge(amount:)` call does not guarantee that tipping flow will be displayed. This is because tipping is not supported by all accounts and all card readers. Tipping is only supported with the Zettle Card Reader. The function is introduced market by market. If card reader software doesn’t support tipping, users will be prompted to either skip tipping or update card reader software.

Total tip amount is presented in `iZettleSDKOperationCompletion` completion with `gratuityAmount` property.

More documentation on the tipping flow can be found [here](https://github.com/iZettle/sdk-ios/tree/master/Documentation)

### Refunding

Refund an amount from a payment with a given reference.

```objectivec
- (void)refundAmount:(nullable NSDecimalNumber *)amount
ofPaymentWithReference:(NSString *)reference
     refundReference:(nullable NSString *)refundReference
presentFromViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController
          completion:(iZettleSDKOperationCompletion)completion;
```

```swift
open func refund(amount: NSDecimalNumber?, 
  ofPayment reference: String, 
  withRefundReference refundReference: String?, 
  presentFrom viewController: UIViewController, 
  completion: @escaping iZettleSDK.iZettleSDKOperationCompletion)
```

- `amount` _(optional)_: The amount to be refunded from the payment (passing `nil` will refund full amount of original payment)
- `reference`: The reference of the payment that is to be refunded.
- `refundReference` _(optional)_: The reference of the refund. Max length 128.

**Note:** Demo accounts (accounts that automatically revert performed payments) cannot be used to perform refunds. To test refund functionality please use a standard production Zettle account.

### Retrieving payment info

Query Zettle for payment information of a payment with a given reference.

```objective-c
- (void)retrievePaymentInfoForReference:(NSString *)reference
                             completion:(iZettleOperationCompletion)completion;
```

```swift
open func retrievePaymentInfo(for reference: String, 
  presentFrom viewController: UIViewController, 
  completion: @escaping iZettleSDK.iZettleSDKOperationCompletion)
```

### Presenting settings

Present Zettle settings view. The user can switch account, access the Zettle FAQ, view card reader settings etc.

```objective-c
- (void)presentSettingsFromViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;
```

```swift
open func presentSettings(from viewController: UIViewController)
```

### Abort operation

Attempt aborting the ongoing operation. Only use this if absolutely necessary. The state of the payment will 
be unknown to the user after this call.

```objective-c
- (void)abortOperation;
```

```swift
open func abortOperation()
```

### Enforced User Account

You can restrict the usage of the SDK to a certain Zettle account by defining it through the `iZettleSDKAuthorization` object during the SDK initialization.

```swift
var enforcedAccount = { "name@zettle.com" }

let authenticationProvider = try iZettleSDKAuthorization(
    clientID: "xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx",
    callbackURL: URL(string: "app-scheme://url")!,
    enforcedAccount: enforcedAccount)

iZettleSDK.shared().start(with: authenticationProvider)
```

Enforced account will be evaluated for each authenticated operation performed in the SDK.

### Programmatically logout

Logout current account

```objective-c
- (void)logout;
```

```swift
open func logout()
```

## iZettleOperationCompletion

### iZettlePaymentInfo

Object that contains information about a payment and the card used.

- `amount` - Total transaction amount (also includes tip amount if applicable)
- `gratuityAmount` - Contains total tip amount if tipping is performed
- `referenceNumber` - Zettles reference to the payment (not to be confused with the reference provided by you during a charge or refund operation)
- `entryMode` - EMV, CONTACTLESS_EMV, MAGSTRIPE_CONTACTLESS, MAGSTRIPE etc. More entry modes might be added independent of SDK version
- `obfuscatedPan` - e.g. _"\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* 1111"_
- `panHash` - a hash of the pan
- `cardBrand`
- `authorizationCode`
- `AID`
- `TSI`
- `TVR`
- `applicationName`
- `numberOfInstallments`
- `installmentAmount`

\* These fields are only available for some entry modes. Don't rely on them being present.

#### Example of a card reader chip payment:

```
entryMode = EMV
obfuscatedPan = "**** **** **** 0640"
panHash = 0092C7D95900033B84CE08B43F7E973485FB7081
cardBrand = MASTERCARD
authorizationCode = 007602
AID = A0000000041010
TSI = 4000
TVR = 8000000000
applicationName = MasterCard
```

#### Example of a card reader contactless payment:

```
entryMode = CONTACTLESS_EMV
obfuscatedPan = "**** **** **** 0640"
panHash = 0092C7D95900033B84CE08B43F7E973485FB7081
cardBrand = MASTERCARD
authorizationCode = 007602
AID = A0000000041010
TVR = 8000000000
applicationName = MasterCard
```

#### Example of a card reader swipe payment:

```
entryMode = MAGSTRIPE
obfuscatedPan = "**** **** **** 2481"
panHash = 99426D012C6740D9AEC8E26580E8640A196E3C27
cardBrand = MASTERCARD
authorizationCode = 004601
```

## Errors

Zettle will display any errors that occur during an operation to the user, the NSError-object returned in the operation completion block is only intended to be used by developers for debugging, diagnostics and logging to be able to better communicate errors to Zettle. You should never present the returned errors to the end user.
