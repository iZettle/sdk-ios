DEVELOPER PLATFORM AGREEMENTLast updated: 15 October 2015These terms and conditions (the “Agreement”) constitute an agreement between iZettle AB, corporate registration number 556806-0734, with its registered office at Regeringsgatan 59, 111 56 Stockholm, Sweden (“iZettle”, “we”, “our” or “us”) and you, the legal entity or sole proprietor identified in connection with your registration of a developer account, (“you”, “your” or “yours”) governing your access to and use of iZettle’s software, software developer kits, libraries, application programming interfaces, documentation, sample code, templates and related materials made available to you by iZettle (the “Developer Materials”). By accepting this Agreement or by accessing and using the Developer Materials you agree to be bound by this Agreement. You may not use the Developer Materials if you do not accept this Agreement. If you are using the Developer Materials on behalf of a legal entity, you warrant that you have authority to bind that legal entity to this Agreement, and by accepting this Agreement, you are doing so on behalf of that legal entity.1. License, Access and Use. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, iZettle grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable right and license to use the Developer Materials to access, use and reproduce those Developer Materials solely for the purposes of developing, testing, and promoting your websites, applications and services (“Applications”) as contemplated by the documentation for the applicable Developer Materials. You may use Developer Materials only in connection with iZettle’s products and services for which they are made available. If the Developer Materials include any libraries, sample code, or other materials we make available specifically for incorporation in your Applications (as indicated by the applicable documentation), you may incorporate those materials in your Applications and reproduce and distribute those Developer Materials as incorporated in your Applications. You may also modify any such sample code to the extent necessary to incorporate it in your Applications. We may modify or discontinue (including by ceasing our distribution of or support for) any or all of the Developer Materials at any time without notice and you are solely responsible for ensuring that your Applications function properly after any such modification or discontinuation. If iZettle assigns you developer credentials, such as client ID and client secret, you must use them with the Developer Materials. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your Applications when using the Developer Materials or your developer account. If iZettle believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limitations, your ability to use the Developer Materials may be temporarily or permanently blocked. You will not use the Developer Materials to encourage or promote illegal activity. You agree that iZettle may monitor your use of the Developer Materials to ensure quality, improve iZettle’s products and services, and to verify your compliance with this Agreement. This monitoring may include iZettle accessing and using your Applications to identify security issues that could affect iZettle or its users. iZettle may suspend access to the Developer Materials by you or your Applications without notice if iZettle reasonably believes that you are in violation of this Agreement. The Developer Materials may include or be distributed with software or other materials that are provided under a separate license agreement (such as an open source license), and that separate license will govern the use of such software or other materials in the event of a conflict with this Agreement. Any such separate license agreement may be indicated in the license, notice, or readme files distributed with the applicable software or other materials or in related documentation.2. Prohibitions and Limitations. You may use the Developer Materials only as expressly authorized under this Agreement only for the purpose of developing, testing, and promoting your Applications as permitted by section 1, and only through the interfaces and functionality we designate. You must comply with all instructions and requirements in any integration documents, guidelines or other documentation that we provide. Except as permitted under section 1, you will not: a) incorporate or compile any portion of the Developer Materials into your Applications or other digital or physical products, b) distribute, sub-license or otherwise provide any portion of the Developer Materials to any third party, c) modify or create derivative works of the Developer Materials, d) reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Developer Materials, e) create any Application that functions substantially in the same way as the Developer Materials and distribute, sub-license or otherwise provide it to any third party, f) perform any action with the intent of introducing to the Developer Materials or any of iZettle’s products or services any viruses, worms, defects, trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature, g) remove, obscure, or alter any iZettle terms of service or any links to or notices of such terms, or h) access the Developer Materials or any of iZettle’s products or services for competitive purposes (including to connect to a competitive product or to create your own competitive product) or publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including uptime, response time and/or benchmarks) relating to the Developer Materials or any of iZettle’s products or services. You may not use the Developer Materials with any software or other materials that are subject to licenses or restrictions (e.g., open source software licenses) that, when combined with the Developer Materials, would require us to disclose, license, distribute or otherwise make all or any part of such Developer Materials available to anyone. You may not remove, modify, or obscure any copyright, patent, trademark or other proprietary or attribution notices on or in any Developer Materials. All licenses and rights granted to you in this Agreement are conditional on your continued compliance with this Agreement, and all such licenses and rights will immediately and automatically terminate if you do not comply with any term or condition of this Agreement.3.

You agree and undertake that at all times your Applications will be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA DSS), as applicable.4. Content and Data. If your Application enables users to access and retrieve data, content or information (“User Data”) from their iZettle accounts, such users must be presented with an ability to log into their iZettle account via the OAuth protocol. If a user of your Application allows your Application to access and retrieve User Data from its iZettle account, you will access only the minimum data fields required for your Application to work properly as permitted by the user and ensure that any User Data retrieved is collected, processed, transmitted, maintained and used in accordance with the terms agreed between you and the user, applicable laws and all reasonable measures that protect the privacy and security of the User Data. Your Application must include your own legally binding terms of use and privacy policy that are publicly available to your users, and such terms of use must contain clear and legally adequate disclosures about the nature of your Application’s integration with iZettle’s services and the User Data you are collecting and how you may use it. Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you will not, and will not permit your users or others acting on your behalf to: a) scrape, build databases or otherwise create permanent copies of any User Data, b) copy, translate, modify, create derivative works of, sell, sublicense, distribute, publicly display or otherwise dispose of any User Data, or c) remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices, or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of material contained in the User Data. Certain APIs may allow submission of data, content, and information. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, iZettle does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights that you or your users hold in data, content or information that you or your users submit to such APIs through your Applications. By submitting data, content or information to or from any APIs through your Applications, you grant iZettle a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive right and license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, display and distribute such data, content and information solely for the purpose of enabling iZettle to provide such APIs and iZettle’s products and services and only in accordance with the applicable iZettle privacy policies. You must ensure that you have the necessary rights and consents (including the necessary rights and consents from your users) to grant iZettle these rights.5. Intellectual Property Rights. As between you and iZettle, iZettle owns all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Developer Materials, iZettle’s Brand Features, iZettle’s products and services, and all related technology, websites and content, and any modifications or derivative works of the foregoing (together, the “iZettle Intellectual Property Rights”).

You acknowledge and agree that such changes may adversely affect how your Application accesses or communicates with the Developer Materials. If any change is unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate this Agreement by ceasing all use of the Developer Materials.
